          <h1>My Resume</h1>
          <p>My name is Sam Millward. I am a student at BYU, currently I am in the pre business program, and I am planning on studying accounting when I finish all of the prerequisites. I had previously studied at BYU Hawaii before I transferred to BYU Provo. As well as studying here at BYU, I also work part time at Chick-Fil-A.</p>
